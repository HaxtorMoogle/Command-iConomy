========= Overview =========
Command iConomy is a plugin that allows a server admin
to assign a cost to server commands that is deducted from
a player's iConomy account whenever a player uses that command.

Commands are matched using java regular expressions. If text 
entered by a player matches a configured rule, Command iConomy 
will attempt to bill the player.

Command iConomy requires iConomy 4.5+ to be installed.

======= Prices.yml ======
The Prices.yml file is used to set the prices for commands.

1. _Match Expressions_
To set the price of a command, add a line to prices.yml. 
Command iConomy matches regular expressions against user 
input. Regular expressions allow you to charge separately 
for individual sub-commands or even specific command arguments.

A typical configuration line looks like this:
^/tp: 10

Command expressions are matched in order from top to bottom. If
a match is found, Command iConomy stops looking for a match and
charges the player the configured amount. If the command is
configured with a cost of zero, processing will stop but the
player will not be charged. Together these features allow open
ended commands to be individually charged. Ex:

^/warp help: 0
^/warp \S+: 10

For more info on regular expressions, see:

2. _Cooldown Timers_
A cooldown timer allows a command to be used freely for a period
of time after it has been paid for. To add a cooldown timer to
a command, add a space after the price, followed by the number
of seconds to allow. For example, to allow a player to warp
as many times as she likes for one minute after paying 10 coin,
make the following your match expression:

^/warp \S+: 10 60

3. _Permissions Nodes_
The following permissions nodes are supported

* CommandIConomy.Free - Grants free access to all commands.

====== Config.yml ======
The following additional commands can be added to config.yml

* Verbose
- Default false. When true, transactions are written to the console.

* ChargeForChat
- Default false. When true, matching expressions are also applied to
  chat. Useful for charging for swear words.

* PayTo
- Default null. When set, Command iConomy will deposit whatever was
  charged from the player into this account.

Three additional settings can be made in the config.yml file
to localize Command iConomy's text. You will have to create
config.yml. They are:

* NoAccountMessage
* InsuficientFundsMessage
* AccountDeductedMessage 
     - Substitute {cost} for cost
