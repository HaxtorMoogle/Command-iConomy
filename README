========= Overview =========
Command iConomy is a plugin that allows a server admin
to assign a cost to server commands that is deducted from
a player's iConomy account whenever a player uses that command.

Commands are matched using java regular expressions. If text 
entered by a player matches a configured rule, Command iConomy 
will attempt to bill the player.

Command iConomy requires iConomy 4.5+ to be installed.

======= Configuration ======
To set the price of a command, add a line to prices.yml. 
Command iConomy matches regular expressions against user 
input. Regular expressions allow you to charge separately 
for individual sub-commands or even specific command arguments.

A typical configuration line looks like this:
^/tp: 10

For more info on regular expressions, see:

=== Internationalization ===
Three additional settings can be made in the config.yml file
to localize Command iConomy's text. You will have to create
config.yml. They are:

* NoAccountMessage
* InsuficientFundsMessage
* AccountDeductedMessage 
     - Substitute {cost} for cost
