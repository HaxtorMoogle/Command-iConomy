========= Overview =========
Command iConomy is a plugin that allows a server admin
to assign a cost to server commands that is deducted from
a player's iConomy account whenever a player uses that command.

Commands are matched using java regular expressions. If text 
entered by a player matches a configured rule, Command iConomy 
will attempt to bill the player.

Command iConomy requires iConomy 4.5+ to be installed.

======= Configuration ======
To set the price of a command, add a line to prices.yml. 
Command iConomy matches regular expressions against user 
input. Regular expressions allow you to charge separately 
for individual sub-commands or even specific command arguments.

A typical configuration line looks like this:
^/tp: 10

Command expressions are matched in order from top to bottom. If
a match is found, Command iConomy stops looking for a match and
charges the player the configured amount. If the command is
configured with a cost of zero, processing will stop but the
player will not be charged. Together these features allow open
ended commands to be individually charged. Ex:

^/warp help: 0
^/warp \S+: 10
